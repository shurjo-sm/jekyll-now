Being stuck in a writer's block for 4 years is not fun. 
I'm at a point where I struggle to write even the simplest of write-ups. It's extremely frustrating. And to make it even worse, one of my most awaited events in life, going to college, is coupled with the dreadfull process of actually applying to college. And so I've decided to start this blog. I have no idea what I'm going to write about. I'm just going to force myself to write at least a few posts a week.

Here goes nothing.
Ad astra per aspera.
